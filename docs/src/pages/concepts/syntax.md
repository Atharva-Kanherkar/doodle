# Syntax

Each algebra comes with extension methods, called *syntax*. These make algebras easier to use. It's because of this syntax that you can write, for example, `circle(10).on(circle(20))` instead of much more complicated expression that explicitly involves algebras. All packages that provide syntax have `syntax` in their name, so you can easily tell when you're bringing them into scope.
