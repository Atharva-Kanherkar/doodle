# Core

The `doodle.core` package provides utilities, such as @:api(doodle.core.Color) and @:api(doodle.core.Point), that are generally useful across all of Doodle. In this chapter we just cover the most important uses. You should see the @:api(doodle.core) API documentation for details.

## Imports

```scala mdoc:silent
// You definitely want doodle.core
import doodle.core.*
// You probably also want extension methods
