# Effects

A picture is a description of what should be drawn. An effect carries out the description by, for example, drawing a picture to the screen. Another example includes converting a picture to a different type or saving it to a file which is managed by a special class of effects called `Writers`.

Effects are defined in the @:api(doodle.effect.index) package. All effects have @:api(doodle.syntax.index) that makes them easier to use. You should not have to use effects directly unless you are extending Doodle.
