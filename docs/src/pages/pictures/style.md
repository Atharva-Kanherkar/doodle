# Style

## Concept

The @:api(doodle.algebra.Style) algebra provides methods to style pictures. There are two main ways in which a picture can be styled:

- the stroke, which specifies the outline of a picture; and
- the fill, which specifies what goes inside a picture.

The default is a black stroke and an empty fill.


## Implementation
